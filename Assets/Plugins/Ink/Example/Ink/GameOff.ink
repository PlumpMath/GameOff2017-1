{increase_stat(romance)} {increase_stat(romance)}{NPC_full_name(Bath, Bath_title)}: My dear friend Samuelâ€™s daughter had the same habit! If youâ€™re feeling listless, I hear there are some wonderful rejuvenating elixirs being created in France using the coca plant. #playSound bathPositive
*[I occasionally drink to excess]
{increase_stat(romance)}{NPC_full_name(Bath, Bath_title)}: Only occasionally? Ah well, at least youâ€™re not a teetotaler. Were you my wife, your tolerance to drink would quickly heighten. #playSound bathPositive
* [I stay away from vice]

Marchioness of Derby: The strangest thing happened the other day. I was walking down Bond doing some shopping, and I could have sworn I saw a lady who looked just like you walk down Regent Street, Camilla.
{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: Oh... that must have been someone else. You know I wouldn't be caught dead on Regent Street. 

Marchioness of Derby: Yes, I thought so at first, but I noticed this woman was wearing a gray hat that looks just like one I've seen you wear.

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: I... I, uh...

{titles} {full_name()}:

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: Do promise you'll keep this quiet, will you mother?

Marchiness of Derby: Really? Oh, how exciting! Your secret is safe with me, Camilla. Do you think you could show me these boutiques some time?

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: ...Perhaps, in the future.

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: I suppose I owe you some sort of gratitude. You were quite congenial with me, even though I used your ill bearing for my own purposes.

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: When youâ€™re advancing through society you exchange pleasantries with many different kinds of people, but I sensed something different when you spoke to me. Was itâ€¦ affection?

{NPC_full_name(Camilla, Camilla_title)}: Well, if youâ€™re in the neighborhood again, do stop by and call sometime. Iâ€™ll be waiting. #playSound camillaPositive

{NPC_full_name(Ascot, Ascot_title)}: Odoroku! I was afraid this party would be a dreadful bore. Thankfully, I found a magnificent conversation partner to help me stay awake.
{NPC_full_name(Ascot, Ascot_title)}: You know, I donâ€™t meet many ladies like you at parties like these. You invest yourself in discussions without losing yourself to them. You jest without descending into impropriety.
{NPC_full_name(Ascot, Ascot_title)}: You even understand the greatness of Nippon!
{NPC_full_name(Ascot, Ascot_title)}: I am of marriageable age, but Iâ€™ve been looking for more than just a wife. I want a companion in my travels and adventures.

{NPC_full_name(Bath, Bath_title)}: Would you do me the honor of letting me give you a carriage ride home?
{NPC_full_name(Bath, Bath_title)}: Oh, but do me one favor. Pay little heed to the rumors surrounding my familyâ€™s estate. My fortunes may have temporarily deserted me, but that shant be the case for long!
